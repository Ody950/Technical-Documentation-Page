      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces. It is not a framework but a
        tool for building UI components. React creates a virtual DOM in memory and updates the actual DOM only when
        necessary. This makes it fast and efficient.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Getting_Started">
      <header>Getting Started</header>
      <p>You can get started with React by following the instructions on the official React website. You can also use
        the command-line interface (CLI) tool create-react-app, which expedites the process of developing a React
        application by installing some packages and creating some files for you. You’ll need to have Node >= 14 on your
        local development machine (but it’s not required on the server).</p>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Components">
      <header>Components</header>
      <p>React components are independent and reusable bits of code that serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions
        but work in isolation and return HTML. In React, we mainly have two types of components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1- Functional Components: Functional components are simply JavaScript functions that return JSX code that
          tells
          what should be rendered on the screen.</li>
        <li>2- Class Components: Class components are more complex than functional components and are used when we need
          more features like local state or lifecycle methods.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Props">
      <header>Props</header>
      <p>React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML. They are used to pass data from
        one component to another. To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes. </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
            function Greeting(props) {
              return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
            }
    
            function App() {
              return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                  &lt;Greeting name="Alice" /&gt;
                  &lt;Greeting name="Bob" /&gt;
                  &lt;Greeting name="Charlie" /&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
              );
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
</body>

</section>

<section class="main-section" id="State">
  <header>State</header>
  <p>The state is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change. It is used to store property
    values that belong to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders. The state object
    is initialized in the constructor.</p>
  <pre>
          <code>
            class Counter extends React.Component {
              constructor(props) {
                super(props);
                this.state = {count: 0};
              }
    
              render() {
                return (
                  &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;You clicked {this.state.count} times&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;button onClick={() => this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1})}&gt;
                      Click me
                    &lt;/button&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
                );
              }
            }
          </code>
        </pre>

<section class="main-section" id="Lifecycle_Methods">
  <header>Lifecycle Methods</header>
  <p>React.js lifecycle methods are used to manage the various stages of a component’s lifecycle, such as mounting,
    updating, and unmounting. Lifecycle methods can be used to perform actions such as fetching data, setting up
    subscriptions, or updating the component’s state.</p>

  <p>React has four built-in methods that get called when mounting a component: React has four built-in methods that get
    called when mounting a component: <kbd>constructor()</kbd>, <kbd>static getDerivedStateFromProps()</kbd>,
    <kbd>render()</kbd>, and <kbd>componentDidMount()</kbd>. When updating a component, the following methods are called
    in this order: static <kbd>getDerivedStateFromProps()</kbd>, <kbd>shouldComponentUpdate()</kbd>,
    <kbd>render()</kbd>, <kbd>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()</kbd>, <kbd>componentDidUpdate()</kbd>. When unmounting a
    component, <kbd>componentWillUnmount()</kbd> is called.</p>

  <p>Lifecycle methods can be used to perform actions such as fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or updating
    the component’s state. They can also be used to clean up resources used by the component when it is removed from
    the DOM.</p>

</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Events">
  <header>Events</header>
  <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used for handling the view layer for web and
    mobile apps. React uses a virtual DOM (a JavaScript representation of the real DOM) to manage the state of the
    application. React also provides a way to handle events in your application.</p>
  <p>In React, events are triggered by user interactions such as clicking on a button or hovering over an element.
    You can use events to update the state of your application and re-render the view.</p>
  <p>Here are some examples of events in React:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>onClick</li>
    <li>onChange</li>
    <li>onSubmit</li>
    <li>onMouseOver</li>
    <li>onMouseOut</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Forms">
  <header>Forms</header>
  <p>To create forms in React, you can use the built-in HTML form elements like input, textarea, select, etc. You
    can also use third-party libraries like Formik to build forms in React. Formik is a popular open-source form
    library for React and React Native that takes care of the repetitive and annoying stuff—keeping track of
    values/errors/visited fields, orchestrating validation, and handling submission—so you don’t have to.</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        &lt;textarea&gt;
          Hello there, this is some text in a text area
          &lt;/textarea&gt;
      </code>
    </pre>

</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Conditional_Rendering">
  <header>Conditional Rendering</header>
  <p>Conditional rendering is a feature in React that allows you to render different components or UI elements based
    on certain conditions. It is used to change the behavior of an app depending on its state. For instance, you can
    change the greeting message of your React app to dark during the night. This way you have a different display
    message depending on the time of day.</p>
  <p>In ReactJS, conditional rendering is referred to as Conditional Rendering. To do this, generate a number of
    components and render them in accordance with certain criteria. There are several ways to use conditional rendering in React. You can use if statements, ternary operators,
    switch statements, and more.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Lists_and_Keys">
  <header>Lists and Keys</header>
  <p>In React, lists are used to display a series of similar items. You can create a list in React by using the
    <kbd>map()</kbd> function to iterate over an array of data and return an array of React elements. Each element in the array
    should have a unique key prop that helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
    Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.</p>
  <p>Keys allow React to keep track of elements. This way, if an item is updated or removed, only that item will be
    re-rendered instead of the entire list.</p>
  <p>Here’s an example of how you can create a list in React:</p>
  <pre>
        <code>
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
        &lt;li key={number.toString()}&gt;
            {number}
          </li>
        );
      </code>
    </pre>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Fragments">
  <header>Fragments</header>
  <p>Fragments are a common pattern in React where a component returns multiple elements. Fragments let you group a
    list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.</p>
  <p>In React, you can use fragments to return multiple elements from a component. The other alternative is to use
    an HTML element like div to wrap them. Fragments are syntax that allow us to add multiple elements to a React component without wrapping them in an
    extra DOM node.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Context_API">
  <header>Context API</header>
  <p> React Context API is a feature in React.js that allows us to pass data through our component trees, giving our
    components the ability to communicate and share data at different levels. It is safe to use in production with
    the version 16.3 or latest.</p>
  <p>The reason for adding context API is to avoid the passing of props if there is a chain of children components.
  </p>
  <p>Here are the four steps to using React context :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Create context using the createContext method.</li>
    <li>2. Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree.</li>
    <li>3. Use the useContext hook to consume the context.</li>
    <li>4. Pass data through the context provider.</li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section class="main-section" id="Hooks">
  <header>Hooks</header>
  <p>React Hooks are a feature in React that allow you use state and other React features without writing classes.
    Hooks were added to React in version 16.8. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
    Hooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or
    combine them to build your own.</p>
  <p>There are several built-in hooks in React such as <kbd>useState</kbd>, <kbd>useEffect</kbd>, <kbd>useContext</kbd>, <kbd>useReducer</kbd>, <kbd>useCallback</kbd>,
  <kbd>useMemo</kbd>, <kbd>useRef</kbd>, and <kbd>useImperativeHandle</kbd>.</p>
  <p>UseState is a Hook that lets you add state to your functional components. It takes an initial value as an
    argument and returns an array with two items: the current state value and a function that lets you update it. useEffect is another Hook that lets you perform side effects in your functional components. It takes two
    arguments: a function that performs the side effect and an array of dependencies that tells React when to re-run
    the effect.</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
        import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You clicked {count} times&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>);}
      </code>
    </pre>
